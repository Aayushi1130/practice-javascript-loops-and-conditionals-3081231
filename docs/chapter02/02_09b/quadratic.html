/*
 * This program determines the solution(s) for the
 * quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
 *
 *   - Prompt the user for values of a, b, and c
 *   - Calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac)
 *   - If the discriminant is negative, tell user there are
 *     no real number solutions.
 *   - Otherwise, if the discriminant is zero, calculate the single solution
 *     (-b / 2a), and print it.
 *   - Otherwise, the discriminant must be greater than zero; calculate
 *     and print both solutions:
 *        (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a and
 *        (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a
