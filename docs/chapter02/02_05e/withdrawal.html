         *   - Prompt the customer for the amount to withdraw

         *       - subtract the amount from the balance
         *       - print the updated balance
         *   - Otherwise:
         *       - tell the customer they can't withdraw more than
         *         their balance.
         *   - Print a "Thank you for banking with us" message
